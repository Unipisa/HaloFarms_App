# HaloFarms

## What's HaloFarms? üéã

The HaloFarMs project, conducted by the University of Pisa in collaboration with multiple countries, aims to optimize agricultural systems in the Mediterranean region by using halophytes, which are plants that can tolerate saline conditions. The project focuses on increasing productivity and quality of crops on saline soils, reducing soil salinity, restoring biodiversity, and diversifying agricultural production. The project involves innovative practices such as joint cultivation of halophytes and commercial crops on saline soils. A crucial aspect of the project is the development of a smartphone app that assists farmers in selecting the most suitable crop for the specific soil conditions. This app provides features like crop identification and perimeter management. By implementing these innovations, the HaloFarMs project aims to increase farmers' incomes while also preserving the environment and strengthening the resilience of the global food system.
